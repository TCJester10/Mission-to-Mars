# Mission-to-Mars
## What for?
My purpose was to create a webapp showcasing the latest information from NASA's information about Mars missions. Using Mongodb, html coding, bootstrap, and flask, 
I created what I desired. The webapp displays basic information about Mars in the form of a dataframe, the latest article from NASA about Mars, a featured image,
and four images of the Martian hemispheres.
